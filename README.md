# RegressorX: DoorDash ETA Optimization
### DoorDash ETA Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for estimating the delivery times for DoorDash using machine learning. The analysis is based on historical data and includes a detailed examination of key factors that impact delivery times. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) to enhance operational efficiency and improve customer satisfaction.

## Summary of Analysis
The DoorDash ETA prediction dataset captures essential data related to the order lifecycle, from order placement to delivery. Key variables influencing delivery durations include time-related features, market and store conditions, and order complexity. Important predictors identified include the number of dashers available, order size, and store type.

## Key Findings
- **Temporal Patterns**: Delivery times are influenced by the time of day, order placement, and market congestion. Increased outstanding orders and active dashers correlate with longer delivery times.
- **Order Complexity**: Larger orders with more items and higher subtotals generally take longer to deliver.
- **Store Influence**: The type of store and dasher availability near the store impact delivery speed. Efficient dasher distribution can help optimize delivery times.
- **Predictive Features**: Variables like `estimated_order_place_duration` and `estimated_store_to_consumer_driving_duration` are valuable for accurate ETA predictions.

## Model Performance Summary
| **Model**          | **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in minutes** | **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in minutes** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **LightGBM**       | 0.58                                      | 1.00                                          |
| **Neural Network** | 1.16                                      | 1.67                                          |
| **Linear Regression** | 4.82                                  | 6.55                                          |

## Model Analysis and Recommendations

### 1. LightGBM Model
- **Performance**: Achieved the best accuracy with an MAE of 0.58 and RMSE of 1.00. This model effectively captures complex data relationships.
- **Recommendation**: LightGBM is ideal for ETA predictions. Further tuning and feature engineering can enhance its performance even more.

### 2. Neural Network Model
- **Performance**: With an MAE of 1.16 and RMSE of 1.67, it performed better than linear regression but less effectively than LightGBM.
- **Recommendation**: While neural networks can model complex relationships, additional training adjustments are needed to optimize performance.

### 3. Linear Regression Model
- **Performance**: Showed the weakest results with an MAE of 4.82 and RMSE of 6.55, highlighting its limitations in capturing data complexities.
- **Recommendation**: Best used as a baseline or for interpretability, not for high-accuracy predictions.

## Recommendations for Improving Delivery Times

### Key Factors Impacting Delivery Time
- **Time-Based Features**: Order placement time and time of day have significant effects.
- **Geographical and Traffic Conditions**: Delivery location and real-time traffic conditions are critical.
- **Order Size and Complexity**: Larger and more complex orders take longer to process.
- **External Conditions**: Weather and unexpected events can also influence delivery duration.

### Suggested Improvements for Business Optimization and Enhanced Model Performance
1. **Real-Time Data Integration**: Use live traffic, weather, and event updates to adjust ETAs dynamically.
2. **Peak Time Management**: Analyze historical data to identify peak delivery times and optimize scheduling.
3. **Routing Optimization**: Implement algorithms for real-time route adjustments based on current traffic and weather conditions.
4. **Data Enrichment**: Incorporate more detailed data on delivery locations and external factors.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to capture traffic congestion and seasonal changes.
6. **Automated Model Adjustments**: Train models on historical data with traffic and weather as features for real-time adaptability.
7. **Feedback Mechanism**: Monitor actual vs. predicted delivery times and use feedback for model updates.

### Data Enhancements
- **Expand Feature Set**: Consider adding driver experience and order priority.
- **Data Quality Control**: Ensure time, distance, and delivery details are accurate and consistently formatted.
- **Noise Reduction**: Use data-cleaning techniques to remove anomalies and keep data realistic.

### Future Model Enhancements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search or Bayesian optimization to fine-tune the LightGBM model.
- **Ensemble Approaches**: Combine the strengths of LightGBM, neural networks, and linear regression for improved predictions.
- **Continuous Model Updates**: Regularly update training data to include recent delivery trends and conditions.
  
Understanding the factors that influence delivery times allows DoorDash to make informed decisions that improve service quality and delivery efficiency. By implementing the strategies outlined, DoorDash can achieve more accurate ETA predictions and optimize scheduling and resource allocation, enhancing the overall customer experience.
